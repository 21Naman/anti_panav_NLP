# PROGRESS — Liar's Chatroom

> The handoff log. A new Claude Code session reads this file instead of old chats.
> Claude updates it at the end of every phase (see CLAUDE.md → Phase protocol).

## Current state
- Mode: PREP            <!-- PREP | REHEARSAL | COMPETITION -->
- Current phase: 0 — not started
- Last completed phase: none
- Next step: start Phase 0 (scaffold)
- Blockers / waiting on: organizers' answer on pseudo-labelling; event start date
- Last updated: 2026-10-27

## Key facts (Claude keeps this current)
- Event dates (48 h window):
- Days left before the event:
- Team members + Kaggle accounts (each has its own GPU quota):
- Python / env:
- Repo URL (private):
- Laptop: CPU only, used for --debug runs
- Kaggle GPU: T4 x2 preferred for 4-bit LLMs — weekly quota used so far:
- GPU hours used in prep (per account):
- Best result so far: (run name — mode — accuracy — on which data)
- Stage-1 / pretrained checkpoints: (run name — path / Kaggle dataset name)
- LLM benchmark winner: (model id — zero-shot acc — chats/min on T4)
- QLoRA time per epoch on T4: (model id — examples — max_len — hours)
- Template packs available: (names)

## Organizer answers (2026-10-26, from the SPOC)
- Dataset size: still being finalised. -> Plan for both small (<5k) and large train sets.
- Public / private leaderboard split: still being finalised.
- External prediction APIs (Claude, OpenAI, ...): NOT allowed. Running LLMs ourselves: allowed.
- Pseudo-labelling (training on model-generated test predictions): will be clarified before the event.
- Submission: CSV file only. A notebook is not required, but top teams may be asked for notebook / code for review.

## Still open
- [ ] Pseudo-labelling allowed? (organizers will clarify)
- [ ] Exact event start date / time?
- [ ] Approximate train and test sizes? (being finalised)
- [ ] Public / private split? (being finalised)
- [ ] Is self-generated synthetic training data allowed? (assumed yes — "any ML/NLP approach"; confirm)
- [ ] Any sample of the data format before the event?

## Decisions register
| Date | Phase | Decision | Why |
|------|-------|----------|-----|
| 2026-10-26 | plan | Rules are written on competition day against the real generator; prep builds only the rules framework | Template-specific rules beat generic ones |
| 2026-10-26 | plan | Speaker permutation is a config switch, decided after the leak check | Real label positions may be non-uniform |
| 2026-10-27 | plan | No external prediction APIs anywhere in the code | Organizer rule (2026-10-26) |
| 2026-10-27 | plan | Open-LLM QLoRA is the main model; open-LLM zero-shot is a core phase | APIs banned, own LLMs allowed; fine-tuned LLMs usually beat DeBERTa on reasoning-style text tasks |
| 2026-10-27 | plan | Expensive LLM runs use holdout mode (1 fold), not 5-fold; ensemble weights fit on the holdout fold | GPU budget |
| 2026-10-27 | plan | DeBERTa is a "Should" phase; synthetic stage-1 pretraining is a switch | Useful ensemble member, but less likely to be the best single model |
| 2026-10-27 | plan | Dropped: API backends, LLM-rewritten synthetic data, model-download datasets | APIs banned; CSV-only means internet is available on Kaggle |
| 2026-10-27 | plan | Pseudo-labelling built behind a switch, default off | Not yet confirmed by organizers |
| 2026-10-27 | plan | In COMPETITION mode Claude Code never reads individual test chats | Keeps test predictions clearly model-only (fair play) |

## Phase log
Claude appends one entry per phase using this template:

```
### Phase N — <name>
- Status: done | partial | skipped
- Date:
- Built: (bullets: module -> what it does)
- Files added/changed:
- Commands (exact, copy-pasteable):
- Results: (metrics, timings, GPU hours, data sizes — small table if useful)
- Done-when checks: (each item -> pass/fail)
- Decisions & deviations from BUILD_MAP.md:
- Known issues / TODO for later phases:
- Explain-it-to-me: (2–4 plain sentences on the key idea, for my methodology write-up)
- Commit: <short hash>
